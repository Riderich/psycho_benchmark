Our codes are separated into two folders. Folder BERT_data_augmentation_code contains a jupyter notebook file, which is copied from the google colab. We put the link to the corresponding google colab notebook directly in the report in case it cannot run well locally. This file contains codes of training, evaluating the BERT model and the implement of data augmentation. Another folder named LSTM_code stores python files used in building and evaluating the LSTM model. This file also contains a data augmentation part, but we did not applied it as it did data augmentation to the testing set, which was not our expectation.
